input:
-- BMRB files (NMR-Star format) with resonance assignments
-- SPARTA+ prediction files (.pred) with predicted chemical shifts 
-- PDB files that were used for the SPARTA+ calculations (via the Bax Lab webserver)

output:
-- SSP-formatted chemical shifts (.co, .ca, .cb, etc)
-- a matrix of residue numbers and chemical shifts (output_.txt)

disorder_prediction:
-- includes predicted values of per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity as obtained with the following software programs:
  -- metapredict
  -- IUPred2A
  -- SPOT-Disorder v1
  -- DISOPRED3 
  
  SSP:
  -- the input and output files for the software program SSP
