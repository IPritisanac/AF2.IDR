Data and code associated with FIG 5 

To run BLASTP on the PDB sequence files and analyse results (as presented in Fig 5 C):
1. Run run_blastp.sh, with PDB sequence database file available on path
	> ./run_blastp.sh HUMAN_IDRS/
2. Process BLASTP results given hits from the previous step and E-value threshold
	> python blastp_processing.py BLASTP_RESULTS/ 0.0001

To generate IDR alignments and analyse them (as presented in Fig 5 D&E):

1. Run get_idrs_from_alignment.py
	> python get_idrs_from_alignment.py IDR_SEQ_ALIGNMENTS/ pLDDT_IDRS/UP000005640_9606_HUMAN_pLDDT_scores_DISORDERED_THRESH_above_70_JOINT_CONSECUTIVE_MIN_10AA.out.txt IDR_SEQ_ALIGNMENTS/pLDDT_ABOVE_70/
2. Run analyse_idr_alignment.py on directory containing IDR sequence alignments of interest
	>python analyse_idr_alignment.py IDR_SEQ_ALIGNMENTS/pLDDT_ABOVE_70/

To compute positional sequence conservation of IDR sequence alignments and analyse them (as presented in Fig5 F):

1. Run positional sequence conservation using adaptation of code from Capra JA and Singh M.** (run_score_conservation.py, which calls score_conservation_IDR.py):
	> python run_score_conservation.py IDR_SEQ_ALIGNMENTS/pLDDT_ABOVE_70/
2. Run analyse_idr_conservation.py on directory containing ‘*_CONS.out.txt’ files from the previous step
	>python analyse_idr_conservation.py IDR_SEQ_ALIGNMENTS/pLDDT_ABOVE_70/

**For more details on the software from Capra & Singh see (README_SCORE_CONSERVATION.txt)

Directories D&E and F contain data presented in panels D&E and F of the Figure 5
